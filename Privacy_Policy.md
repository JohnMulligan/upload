# Privacy Policy

The developers of this CRC Special Collections uploader application do not collect user data beyond usage analytics that the Apple Store makes available in the developer's dashboard.

This application does not itself link to any third parties, but you must connect to a remote Omeka-S server using API credentials with read/write permissions enabled in order for the application to work as intended.

Your API credentials (for connecting to a remote Omeka-S server) are stored in a hashed file on the user's device.

The developers cannot provide you with your own Omeka-S server, or credentials to such a server. You must supply this yourself.


Users should be aware that this application does use external packages and the iOS SDK, both of which do have affordances for data collection. The exact dependencies we use may change -- they can be viewed in this repository's codebase.
